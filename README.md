Some codes created while learning the finite element method using MATLAB
## Mesh Generation
All codes can utilize the DistMesh mesh generation tool developed by Per-Olof Persson (UC Berkeley) and Gilbert Strang (MIT). See http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/ for the MATLAB code and documentation.

Gmsh is also an option for mesh generation in the ```poisson2D.m``` script (using the conversion script ```gmsh2matlab.m``` in the *scripts* directory). Gmsh is developed by Christophe Geuzaine and Jean-Fran√ßois Remacle. See http://gmsh.info/ for more information and documentation.
