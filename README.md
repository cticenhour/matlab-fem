Some codes created while learning the finite element method using MATLAB. Note: make sure to add all folders to the MATLAB path!
## Mesh Generation
The Poisson2D problem utilizes the DistMesh mesh generation tool developed by Per-Olof Persson (UC Berkeley) and Gilbert Strang (MIT). See http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/ for the MATLAB code and documentation.

Gmsh is the mesh generation tool for all other problems. Gmsh is developed by Christophe Geuzaine and Jean-Fran√ßois Remacle. See http://gmsh.info/ for more information and documentation.
